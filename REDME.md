# Automated Service Addition  

Adding a new online service for a group of users (around 500) could have been a daunting and time-consuming task. Here's how I met the challenge with an effective solution.    

---

## The Problem  
The management interface lacked a feature for batch modifications. This limitation meant that adding the new service would require a manual, user-by-user update â€” a tedious and inefficient process.  

---

## The Solution  
To overcome this challenge, I devised a smarter, automated approach:  
- **Automation**: Developed a process to handle updates programmatically.  
- **POST Request**: Utilized the browser console to send a POST request directly to the server, bypassing the manual interface.  

This method eliminated the need for manual intervention and ensured all users received the service update accurately and consistently.

## The Result  
- **Time-Saving**: The task, which could have taken hours, was completed in just a few moments.  
- **Efficiency**: The process was seamless, organized, and repeatable for similar tasks in the future.  
- **Scalability**: The solution can easily adapt to larger datasets or similar challenges.

By leveraging automation, I turned a potentially arduous task into a streamlined and effective solution, demonstrating the value of problem-solving through technology.
